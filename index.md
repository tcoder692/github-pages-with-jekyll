# Welcome

Hi! In this article, we will be reviewing 3 operating systems and how they work. Let's get started shall we?









# #1 Windows

Windows is an operating system made my Microsoft. It is by far the most popular and used operating system in the work. Many people chose it because it is
cheaper and user friendly. It is also a good alternative to MacOS for those who cannot afford it. In my opinion, Windows is not very good. I think that Linix
is better, faster, more organized, and has a good user interface. 







# #2 MacOS 

You all probbably know MacOS right? MacOS is known for it's high speed and excellent features. However, what makes it different is that
you can install it on any hardware, it must be bought as a MacBook unlike Linux and Windows. MacOS is pretty much Windows, Linux, and UNIX all together
if you think about it. MacBooks are pretty expensive though, not many people are able to afford it.






# #3 Linux

Linux is an operating system that provides many distributions such as Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Edubuntu, and PearOS. Linux is a great opearting system for 
developers as they can write code in the terminal and easily access root files. However, Linux is struggling to get popular because it doesn't have an
OS like WindowsOS and MacOS. It is also failing desktop because of this reason. Linux came before MacOS, but MacOS got it's ideas from Linux and made it
Linux has a good user interface and, it is organized, fast, and highly secure. In fact, it is more secure than MacOS X believe it or not.
If you are thinking of switching from Windows or MacOS X to Linux, then go for it because it's definitely worth it.








# #4 ChromeOS

Ok, I am pretty sure you have heard of a ChromeBook right? I mean it's getting so popular since all your work is on the internet now.
Just click, search, and your on your way. So, Google thought "Why not make a computer where you can only use the web?" Of course they 
made the search engine Chrome. At that time, ChromeBooks started to get popular. The only thing a ChromeBook has though is Files, Camera, and Chrome.
CAN YOU BELIEVE that you cannot download apps on it!? You can only visit the Chrome Web Store to get extensions. Now that's what I call not user friendly.
Anyways, ChromeOS is based on Linux Kernel, this will mean that there's always the option to enable "Linux" in ChromeOS Sttings. If you are using a ChromeBook now,
you can do that here: chrome://os-settings/crostini. I think that this option makes a ChromeBook more enjoyable. With this feature on, you can use the Linux Terminal, download apps and files from the internet, and have access to many other features that ChromeOS blocks.






UNIX is a great operating system with functionality, booting, and more. 
UNIX has the following advantages compared with other operating systems:

Excellent use and control of system resources
Very high reliability (long uptimes between reboots)
Tools for customizing the system are either native and bundled with the operating system or are easily available free
In the case of open source systems such as Linux, no software licensing hassles for commonly used software
Far better scalability than any other OS, save (maybe) for mainframe systems
Readily available, searchable, complete documentation both on the system and online via the Internet
Massive stores of free software available for downloading and building
